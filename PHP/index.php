<h2>About me:</h2>
<h3>
I have a strong interest in software/web security, which is partly why I am taking this couse. I hope to gain a greater understanding of how web applications work and how they break. Also, I want to gain a better understading of web elements since so many softwares are now sold a software as a service.
